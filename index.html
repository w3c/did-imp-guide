    <h2>Methods</h2>

    <p class="note">
      See [[DID-CORE]] for normative requirements associated with developing
      <a data-cite="DID-CORE#methods">DID methods</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Avoid introducing requirements in your DID method specification that are
      neither described in [[DID-CORE]] nor registered in the
      [[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
    </p>

    <p>
      Avoid constructing a new DID Method that is nearly identical to an
      existing DID Method.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are several "families" of DID methods, including
      <a href="https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Hyperledger
        Indy</a>, <a
        href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree</a>, and
      various methods that share similar smart contracts or rely on shared
      content addressing technology.
    </p>

    <p class="advisement">
      Implementers are cautioned to write and regularly run integration and
      interoperability tests that span these "families", in order to ensure
      methods have sufficient support for open standards and real
      interoperability.
    </p>

    <p>
      The primary user-facing aspects of a DID method are its
      <a href="#did-syntax">DID Syntax</a> and its
      <a href="#verifiable-data-registry">Verifiable Data Registry</a>.
      Together these determine most of the unique properties of a DID method,
      and its privacy and security properties for comparison to other methods.
    </p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>DID Syntax</h3>
      <p class="note">
        See [[DID-CORE]] for normative requirements associated with developing
        <a data-cite="DID-CORE#did-syntax">DID Syntax</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Avoid allowing users to control the structure of the DID Unique
        Suffix, also referred to as the <code>method-specific-id</code> in the
        <a data-cite="DID-CORE#did-syntax">DID Syntax ABNF</a>. This
        can be accomplished by coupling the
        <a data-cite="DID-CORE#method-operations">Create operation</a>
        canonical representation to the <code>method-specific-id</code>. It can
        also be accomplished by leveraging sources of entropy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Avoid vanity DIDs such as, for example,
        <code>did:example:deadbeef1f236...</code>. The structure of the
        identifier should not be relied on for anything other than collision
        resistance. Be especially careful of trusting a relationship between a
        <a data-cite="DID-CORE#dfn-did-subjects">DID subject</a> and
        <a data-cite="DID-CORE#dfn-did-controllers">DID controller</a>
        without relying on a cryptographically secure
        <a data-cite="DID-CORE#verification-relationships">verification
          relationship</a>
        for <a href="#authentication">authentication</a>.
        Anyone can claim a DID, but only someone who controls the associated
        keys can authenticate their association with the DID.
        For example `did:example:xyzcorp` should not be assumed to belong to
        XYZ Corp.
      </p>

      <p>
        Depending on the nature of the
        <a href="#verifiable-data-registry">VDR</a>, publishing
        <code>type</code> or <code>kind</code> might be advantageous for
        decentralized discovery or mass surveillance. Implementers are not to
        rely on conformance to specification text while implementing
        decentralized identifiers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Verifiable Data Registry</h2>

      <p class="note">
        See [[DID-CORE]] for normative requirements associated with developing
        <a data-cite="DID-CORE#dfn-verifiable-data-registry">Verifiable Data
          Registries</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="#verifiable-data-registry">VDR</a> is the system to which
        <a data-cite="DID-CORE#method-operations">DID method operations</a>
        such as Create, Resolve, Update, and Deactivate are applied.
      </p>

      <p>
        Typically a globally-unique, tamper-evident, immutable log is used to
        produce a verifiable data registry.
      </p>

      <p>
        Blockchains or distributed ledgers are popular choices for building
        verifiable data registries, but there are other solutions. Each yield
        unique security pros and cons.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some DID methods rely on centralized trusted service providers and
        Merkle proofs to provide tamper-evident logs without the costs
        associated with distributed consensus.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some DID methods rely on multiple registries that may not be globally
        available.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some DID methods might rely on legacy security infrastructure, such as
        <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446">Transport Layer
          Security</a> or
        <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Few DID methods support portability across verifiable data
        registries. Altering the VDR associated with a DID will almost
        certainly impact Privacy and Security considerations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead of designing complex DID methods with registry portability,
        consider supporting multiple DID methods that have each been designed
        to support disjoint security and/or privacy consideration, such as
        global discoverability, offline functionality, pairwise uniqueness,
        linkage to existing roots of trust such as websites, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        Depending on the nature of the VDR, it may be desirable to store data
        other than DID documents, such as verifiable credentials,
        templates or schemas for credentials, discovery metadata, or integrity-
        or content-addressable identifiers for related information.

      <h2>Establishing a DID</h2>

      <p>
        In order to create secure DID systems, it is important to consider the
        process of establishing a Decentralized Identifier.
      </p>


      <p class="advisement">
        Establishing cryptographic assurances for the identifier from its
        inception is critical to ensuring that the security of the system isn't
        compromised through attacks against the creation process.
      </p>

      <p>A commonly observed process for establishing a decentralized identifier
        is:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Obtain <code>entropy</code> from a source of randomness that is as
          close to actually random as possible.
        </li>
        <li>Generate a first verification method from <code>entropy</code>.</li>
        <li>Use the first verification method to perform a <a
            data-cite="DID-CORE#method-operations">DID Create
            operation</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="note">
        The Create Operation will often use the first verification method
        directly, or a deterministic
        function thereof, such as a hash, to construct and register the DID.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        True randomness is <b>hard</b> to get. Public sources such as the
        <a
          href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/interoperable-randomness-beacons">NIST
          Randomness Beacon</a>
        are reliable but not appropriate for use directly as a secret key. See
        the section on <a href="#randomness">Randomness</a> for more information.
      </p>
    </section>



    <section class="informative">
      <h2>DID Resolution</h2>

      <p class="note">
        See [[DID-CORE]] for normative requirements associated with developing
        <a data-cite="DID-CORE#did-resolution">DID Resolution</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        DID resolution is a function which takes a DID, and produces a DID
        resolution result in a representation, most commonly
        <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8259">JSON</a>.
      </p>



      <p>
        DID resolution can be proxied through intermediaries such as
        command-line
        tools or HTTP servers. Because the DID document contains key
        material, such intermediaries represent excellent targets for attackers,
        who can use the intermediaries to tamper with verification
        relationships.
      </p>

      <p>
        Avoid tampering with a DID document that has been returned by a
        <a data-cite="DID-CORE#dfn-did-resolvers">DID resolver</a>.
        It is better to throw an error than to attempt to solve problems
        in the underlying DID method.
      </p>

      <p>
        Avoid transforming DID documents without the consent of the DID subject
        or controller.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whenever possible, run all software necessary to support a DID Method
        yourself.
      </p>

        <h3>DID URL Syntax</h3>

        <p class="note">

          <a data-cite="DID-CORE#did-url-syntax">DID URL Syntax</a>.

        <p>
          <a data-cite="DID-CORE#dfn-did-urls">DID URLs</a>
          can be used to identify sub-resources inside a DID document,
          older versions of a DID document, or resources outside of a DID

        <p>
          The [[DID-CORE]] specification describes representations. The
          [[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]] supports the registration of an unbounded
          number of alternative representations.

        <p>Each representation has unique pros and cons.</p>

        <p>

        </p>

        <p>
          DID method implementers may choose to return verification methods in
          alternate formats for representations, for example, an implementer
          might prefer to return verification material encoded with
          <code>publicKeyJwk</code> for <code>application/did+json</code> and
          <code>publicKeyBase58</code> for <code>application/did+ld+json</code>.

      <p>
        The <a data-cite="DID-CORE#data-model">DID document data model</a>
        contains <a data-cite="DID-CORE#core-properties"
          data-lt="DID core properties">properties</a> (such as `id`,
        `verificationMethod`, and `service`), which are
        defined in a way that is independent of a concrete representation. There
        are a number of known
        <a data-cite="DID-CORE#representations">representations</a>,
        including
        <a data-cite="DID-CORE#json" data-lt="JSON representation">JSON</a>
        and <a data-cite="DID-CORE#json-ld" data-lt="JSON-LD
          representation">JSON-LD</a> (defined by DID Core), and
        <a data-cite="DID-CBOR-REPRESENTATION#the-plain-cbor-representation"
           data-lt="Plain CBOR Representation">CBOR</a>
        (defined by a DID WG Note). Additional representations
        (such as XML, YAML, CBOR-LD, and others) are possible and could be
        defined
        in the future. For each of these
        representations, a combination of production and consumption rules
        defines the concrete syntax of properties,
        but
        the semantics of properties are independent of any given representation.
        In other words, in every
        <a data-cite="DID-CORE#dfn-representations">representation</a>
        of a <a data-cite="DID-CORE#dfn-did-documents">DID document</a>,
        there is always a way to represent a `service` or a
        `verificationMethod`, and their meanings
        are consistent across conformant representations.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to <a data-cite="DID-CORE#core-properties" data-lt="DID
          core properties">properties</a>, a DID document may contain
        <a
          data-cite="DID-CORE#dfn-representation-specific-entry">representation-specific
          entries</a> which may be
        required by certain representations in order to fully represent the
        <a data-cite="DID-CORE#data-model">DID document data model</a> and its
        properties. For example, the <a data-cite="DID-CORE#json-ld">JSON-LD
          representation</a> of a DID document
        (with media type
        `application/did+ld+json`) requires the
        `@context` representation-specific entry, in order to correctly express
        the semantics of properties such as
        `id`,
        `verificationMethod` or `service` within the JSON-LD representation.
        This enables JSON-LD’s semantics which are
        based on a decentralized, permissionless, open-world data model.
      </p>

      <p>
        In contrast to this, the (non-LD) <a data-cite="DID-CORE#json">JSON
        representation</a> (with media type `application/did+json`) does not
        have this semantic
        capability; instead, (non-LD) JSON documents always need agreement on
        semantics in some out-of-band way that is
        not part of the document itself. In the case of DID documents using the
        (non-LD) JSON representation, those
        semantics are
        typically established by the <a
          href="https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/">DID Spec
          Registries</a>.
        Therefore,
        establishing semantics of DID document properties in the (non-LD) JSON
        representation does not require
        the representation-specific `@context` entry, as is required by the
        JSON-LD representation.
      </p>

      <p>
        As with the (non-LD) JSON representation compared to the JSON-LD
        representation, similar considerations apply between the (non-LD) CBOR
        representation and the CBOR-LD representation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other examples of <a
          data-cite="DID-CORE#dfn-representation-specific-entry">representation-specific
          entries</a> could be XML
        namespace definitions or YAML tags, although
        these particular representations have not been defined at the time of
        this writing.
      </p>

      <p>
        If an entry that is specific to one representation appears in another
        representation, it can be called a
        <dfn>representation-foreign entry</dfn>.  An example of this is a
        `@context`
        entry appearing in the

          Avoid representation-foreign entries
        </h3>

        <p class="advisement">
          It is bad practice and potentially harmful for producers to include
          "representation-foreign entries" in DID
          documents.
        </p>

        <p>
          Different implementations of DID document consumers may or may not be
          able to properly understand the meaning
          and processing rules of representation-foreign entries. Since DIDs and
          DID documents form an open ecosystem
          with
          many producers and consumers, a producer cannot anticipate the
          behavior of a consumer with regard to
          representation-foreign entries.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, if a producer adds an
          <a data-cite="DID-CORE#dfn-context"><code>@context</code></a>
          entry to a DID document in the
          <a data-cite="DID-CORE#json"><code>application/did+json</code></a>
          representation, some consumers (those that understand JSON-LD, such as
          JSON-LD document loaders) may process
          it
          in one way, while other consumers (those that only understand plain
          JSON, without any JSON-LD specific rules)
          may process it in a different way.
        </p>

        <p>
          This can lead to inconsistent behavior by consumers that cannot be
          predicted by a producer.

          Reliance on representation-foreign entries

          It is bad practice and potentially harmful for consumers to rely on
          <dfn>representation-foreign entries</dfn> in DID
          documents.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a special case of the previous section, certain consumers may go as
          far as relying on the presence of
          representation-foreign entries. For example, an incorrectly
          implemented consumer of DID documents in the
          `application/did+json` representation may attempt to apply JSON-LD
          tooling to that representation. That
          tooling
          is dependent on the presence of the `@context` representation-foreign
          entry, which is not actually required
          (and
          in fact discouraged) to be used in the `application/did+json`
          representation.
        </p>

        <p>
          The result is lack of interoperability, since such consumers will
          throw errors even if the returned DID
          document
          representation is actually conformant.

          Security problems with representation-foreign entries
        </h3>

        <p>
          If some implementations of DID document consumers process
          representation-foreign entries, and others don’t,
          then
          this can lead to security holes, since the semantics of DID document
          properties will not be interpreted in a
          predictable way.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, consider the following DID document, and assume that the
          JSON-LD context
          `https://example.com/myextensions/other-definitions.jsonld` defines
          `blockchainAccountId` in a way that is different
          from the <a 
            data-cite="did-spec-registries#blockchainaccountid">property
            listed in the DID
            Specification Registries</a>.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight"

  ],

  }]
}
      </pre>

        <p>
          If this DID document is consumed as `application/did+json` by an
          implementation that doesn't understand
          JSON-LD,
          it will interpret `blockchainAccountId` as the <a 
            data-cite="did-spec-registries#blockchainaccountid">property
            listed in the DID
            Specification Registries</a>, and it will process it accordingly.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the exact same DID document is consumed as `application/did+json`
          by an implementation that understands
          JSON-LD, it may interpret `blockchainAccountId` using the provided
          JSON-LD context, and therefore process it
          differently.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is a common mistake to claim that "JSON-LD is just JSON", and to
          justify injecting the `@context`
          representation-foreign entry into a DID document in the
          `application/did+json` representation. This claim
          however is true only on the syntax level, but wrong and dangerous on
          the semantic level, especially when
          security-related properties are involved. In the example above,
          different consumer implementations are likely
          to
          come to different conclusions on how the DID can be controlled.
        </p>

        <p class="advisement">
          Representation-foreign entries in DID documents should be avoided,
          since they can lead to inconsistent and

        <h3>
          Conversion between Representations
        </h3>

        <p>
          The DID document data model and the production/consumption rules of
          representations have been designed to
          enable
          lossless conversion between representations. Conversion between
          representations is achieved by executing the
          consumption rules of the source representation, and then the
          production rules of the target representation.
        </p>

        <p>
          The DID Specification Registries [[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]] provide additional
          information about properties as well as representation-specific
          entries that help with such conversion. For
          example, a DID document in the `application/did+json` representation
          can be converted to the
          `application/did+ld+json` representation by adding a `@context`
          representation-specific entry during
          production,
          using the JSON-LD context information in the DID Specification Registries [[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
        </p>

        <p>
          Conversely, a DID document in the `application/did+ld+json`
          representation can be converted to the
          `application/did+json` representation by removing the `@context`
          representation-specific entry during
          consumption.
        </p>

        <p class="advisement">
          Representation-foreign entries in DID documents should be avoided,
          since the implications on lossless
          conversion
          between representations is unclear.

      <p>
        Implementers are not required to support all representations.
        For example, an implementation might choose to only support
        <code>application/did+json</code>,
        and choose not to support <code>application/did+ld+json</code>,
        <code>application/did+dag+cbor</code>,

        etc...
      </p>

      <p>
        Implementers might prefer to use JSON or YAML representations to

      <p>
        When converting between an implementation of the abstract data model and
        a
        representation that is capable of preserving all properties,
        all properties SHOULD be preserved.
      </p>

      <p>For example, preserving <code>@context</code> in YAML,
        allows for the document to later be used with

        Never store personal data, even in an encrypted format, on any
        verifiable data
        registry backed by immutable storage.

      <p>
        It is the DID method implementer's responsibility to think about and
        identify
        the extent to which personal data may be included in a DID document.
      </p>

      <p>
        Software should at least display a warning and ask for confirmation
        before creating
        or updating any properties of a DID document that depend on user
        provided inputs.
      </p>

      <p>
        A DID method specification should have a section dedicated to personal
        data covering the extent to
        which information published on the corresponding ledger can be updated
        or deleted.
        It should provide specific instructions of how to do so, if it is
        possible.
        Otherwise, it should clearly state that it is not possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        A DID method should avoid "phone home" or tracking characteristics that
        would
        permit tracing of a user in manner not understood or authorized by the

      Decentralized Identifiers are security primitives that are often used to
      secure important systems. This section speaks to topics that
      implementers might consider when thinking about the security
      characteristics of their software systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pay very close attention to the defense, cryptographic agility, and
      political
      acceptability of any cryptography you rely on for DID Method security.
    </p>

    <p>
      Avoid complex or slow signature formats, especially if they are poorly
      documented, or do not have an open standard with well documented test
      vectors.

    <p class="advisement">
      Avoid open source implementations that are declared a "defacto
      standard", but lack open standard technical specifications.

      <h3>Vendor Lock In</h3>
      <p>
        Competition, direct substitutability, interoperability, and mutual
        feature support are key to reducing the barriers to adoption of, and
        increasing confidence in, your DID Method.
      </p>

      <p>
        Avoid inventing "new features". Work with others to find a common way
        to express any new features that are not unique to your DID Method.
      </p>

      <p>
        Avoid hard coupling to specific networks, such as Bitcoin or
        Hyperledger Fabric. Design your method such that it may be adapted
        to support multiple ledger systems.

      A reliable guide for making assessments of various technologies and weighing

        Decentralized Identifiers may come to underpin much of our digital life. This

        shared between friends and family. Identifiers representing these personas and 
        relationships are some of the most important in people's lives, and great care 
        should be taken when securing an identifier system that supports these critical

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Environmental Principles as Applied to DID method development</h3>
        <p>
          When implementing or utilizing a DID method, consideration should be given
          to the environmental impacts of any underlying technologies.  
          Avoidance of excess energy use that does not further other equally important 
          goals such as human rights or personal privacy, particularly when that energy 
          is sourced from non-sustainable energy creation methods, is a best 
          practice that serves the interest of all.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          Direct comparison of each factor, and the balances between them, should be
          considered when evaluating particular methods or approaches. Notably, the
          ability to misuse or control DIDs that could impede privacy might be
          found to be inversely correlated with additional energy consumption.
        </p>
        
        <p class="advisement">
          The guiding principle that 
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/#sustainable">the
          web must be an environmentally sustainable platform</a> should be followed.
          <br />As part of following this principle,    
          utilizing or authoring DID methods that require unsustainably-sourced 
          energy as part of their technical implementation or utilization should
          be very carefully considered in balance against alternative approaches.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          When selecting a DID method, the method that minimizes energy consumption 
          while meeting privacy, interoperability, and other technical requirements
          should generally be chosen.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="informative">
        <h3>Environmental Impact Assesment</h3>
        
        <p>
          The energy usage and other environmental impacts of a DID-based solution
          should also be compared to existing approaches, which are often paper based
          and/or require shipment of legacy certificates via air or other methods, and
          thus can have extremely high environmental impacts. These should be factored
          in when performing an assessment of energy usage and environmental impacts
          of potential replacement solutions based on DIDs.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Utilizing or authoring DID methods that compromise on
          the principles of security and / or control for other principles
          of such as environmental concerns should be very carefully 
          considered in balance against alternative approaches that may
          provide the highest levels of security and protection.
          The specific use case for a DID method will help determine the
          optimal approach.  For matters that concern human rights, selection 
          of approaches that are weighted towards privacy and control should 
          outweigh other considerations.
        </p>

        <p class="advisement">
          It is strongly recommended that authors of DID methods provide an assessment
          of energy usage and impact of their DID method, preferably performed by
          an independent third party.

        The maximum interoperable URL length is currently about

        [[VC-DATA-MODEL]]. Future versions of the specification will
        describe in more detail how <a
          data-cite="DID-CORE#dfn-decentralized-identifiers">DIDs</a>
        and <a data-cite="DID-CORE#dfn-did-documents">DID document</a> can
        be integrated with &mdash; and help enable &mdash; the Verifiable
        Credentials ecosystem.

      <h2>Alternate Serializations and Graph Models</h2>

      <p>
        This version of the specification relies on JSON-LD and the RDF
        graph model for expressing a <a
          data-cite="DID-CORE#dfn-did-documents">DID document</a>. Future
        versions of
        this specification might specify other semantic graph formats for a
        <a data-cite="DID-CORE#dfn-did-documents">DID document</a>.
