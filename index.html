  <section class="informative">
    <h2>Methods</h2>

    <p class="note">
      See [[DID-CORE]] for normative requirements associated with developing
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID Methods</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Avoid introducing requirements in your DID method specification that are
      neither described in [[DID-CORE]] nor registered in the
      [[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]].
    </p>

    <p>
      Avoid constructing a new DID Method that is nearly identical to an existing
      DID Method.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are several "families" of DID Methods, including
      <a href="https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Hyperledger Indy</a>, <a
        href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree</a>, and
      various methods that share similar smart contracts or rely on shared
      content addressing technology.
    </p>

    <p class="advisement">
      Implementers are cautioned to write and regularly run integration and
      interoperability tests that span these "families", in order to ensure
      methods have sufficient support for open standards and real
      interoperability.
    </p>

    <p>
      The primary user-facing aspects of a DID Method are its
      <a href="#did-syntax">DID Syntax</a> and its
      <a href="#verifiable-data-registry">Verifiable Data Registry</a>.
      Together these determine most of the unique properties of a DID Method,
      and its privacy and security properties for comparison to other methods.
    </p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>DID Syntax</h3>
      <p class="note">
        See [[DID-CORE]] for normative requirements associated with developing
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-syntax">DID Syntax</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Avoid allowing users to control the structure of the DID Unique
        Suffix, also referred to as the <code>id-char</code> in the ABNF. This
        can be accomplished by coupling the create operation canonical
        representation to the <code>id-char</code>. It can also be
        accomplished by leveraging sources of entropy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Avoid vanity DIDs such as, for example,
        <code>did:example:deadbeef1f236...</code>. The structure of the
        identifier should not be relied on for anything other than collision
        resistance. Be especially careful of trusting a relationship between a
        DID subject and DID controller without relying on a cryptographically
        secure verification relationship for
        <a href="authentication">authentication</a>.
        Anyone can claim a DID, but only someone who controls the associated
        keys can authenticate their association with the DID.
        For example `did:example:xyzcorp` should not be assumed to belong to
        XYZ Corp.
      </p>

      <p>
        Depending on the nature of the
        <a href="#verifiable-data-registry">VDR</a>, publishing
        <code>type</code> or <code>kind</code> might be advantageous for
        decentralized discovery or mass surveillance. Implementers are not to
        rely on conformance to specification text while implementing
        decentralized identifiers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Verifiable Data Registry</h2>

      <p class="note">
        See [[DID-CORE]] for normative requirements associated with developing
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-verifiable-data-registry">Verifiable Data Registry</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="#verifiable-data-registry">VDR</a> is the system to which
        DID Operations such as Create, Resolve, Update, and Deactivate are
        applied.
      </p>

      <p>
        Typically a globally-unique, tamper-evident, immutable log is used to
        produce a verifiable data registry.
      </p>

      <p>
        Blockchains or distributed ledgers are popular choices for building
        verifiable data registries, but there are other solutions which yield
        unique security pros and cons.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some DID methods rely on centralized trusted service providers and
        Merkle proofs to provide tamper-evident logs without the costs
        associated with distributeted consensus.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some DID methods rely on multiple registries that may not be globally
        available.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some DID methods might rely on legacy security infrastructure, such as
        TLS or TOR.
      </p>

      <p>
        Few DID methods support portability accross verifiable data
        registries, and altering the VDR associated with a DID will almost
        certainly impact Privacy and Security considerations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Intead of designing complex DID Methods with registry portability,
        consider supporting multiple DID methods that have each been designed
        to support disjoint security and/or privacy consideration, such as
        global discoverability, offline functionality, pairwise uniqueness, 
        linkage to existing roots of trust such as websites, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        Depending on the nature of the VDR, it may be desirable to store data
        other than DID Documents, such as verifiable credentials,
        templates or schemas for credentials, discovery metadata, or integrity-
        or content-addressable identifiers for related information.

      <h2>Establishing a DID</h2>

      <p>
        In order to create secure DID systems, it is important to consider the process
        of establishing a Decentralized Identifier.
      </p>


      <p class="advisement">
        Establishing cryptographic assurances for the identifier from its
        inception is critical to ensuring that the security of the system isn't
        compromised through attacks against the creation process.
      </p>

      <p>A commonly observed process for establishing a decentralized identifier is:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Obtain <code>entropy</code> from a source of randomness that is as close to actually random as possible.
        </li>
        <li>Generate a first verification method from <code>entropy</code>.</li>
        <li>Use the first verification method to perform a DID Create Operation.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="note">
        The Create Operation will often use the first verification directly, or a deterministic 
        function thereof, such as a hash, to construct and register the DID.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        True randomness is <b>hard</b> to get. Sources such as the
        <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/interoperable-randomness-beacons">NIST Randomness Beacon</a>
        are reliable, but should not be used directly as a secret key.
      </p>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>DID Resolution</h2>

    <p class="note">
      See [[DID-CORE]] for normative requirements associated with developing
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-resolution">DID Resolution</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      DID resolution is a function which takes a DID, and produces a DID
      Resolution response in a representation, most commonly JSON.
    </p>

   

    <p>
      DID resolution can be proxied through intermediaries such as command
      line tools or http servers. Because the DID Document contains key
      material, such intermediaries represent excellent targets for attackers,
      who can use the intermediaries to tamper with verification relationships.
    </p>

    <p>
      Avoid tampering with a DID Document that as been returned by DID Method
      software. It is better to throw an error than to attempt to solve problems
      in the underlying DID Method.
    </p>

    <p>
      Avoid transforming DID Documents without the consent of the DID subject
      or controller.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whenever possible, run all software necessary to support a DID Method
      yourself.
    </p>

      <h3>DID URL Syntax</h3>

      <p class="note">
        See [[DID-CORE]] for normative requirements associated with developing
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#did-url-syntax">DID URL Syntax</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        DID URLs can be used to identify sub-resources inside a DID Document,
        older versions of a DID Document, or resources outside of a DID
        Document.
      </p>

      <pre class="example" title="DID URL identifying a verification method in a DID Document">
        did:example:123#primary

          did:example:123?service=packages@relativeRef=/jose/versions/v0.1.2/archive.zip
          </pre>

      <p>
        Adjusting any part of a DID URL, including the <code>did</code>,
        <code>path</code>, or <code>query</code>, changes the identifier.
      </p>

      <p>
        The resource identifiers <code>did:example:123</code>,
        <code>did:example:123/path</code> and
        <code>did:example:123?args=1</code> each identify a unique resource.

        See [[DID-CORE]] for normative requirements associated with developing
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#representations">Representations</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The [[DID-CORE]] specification describes representations and the
        [[DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES]] supports the registration of an unbounded
        number of alternative representations.
      </p>

      <p>Each representation has unique pros and cons.</p>

      <p>
        DID Methods are responsible for producing a DID Document in the
        requested representation.
      </p>

      <p>
        DID Method implementers may choose to return verification methods in
        alternate formats for representations, for example, an implementer
        might prefer to return verification material encoded with
        <code>publicKeyJwk</code> for <code>application/did+json</code> and
        <code>publicKeyBase58</code> for <code>application/did+ld+json</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Avoid allowing arbitrary unknown properties such as <code>__proto__</code>

        <code>application/did+json</code> .
      </p>

      <p>
        While <code>application/did+json</code> is very flexible and allows

      </p>

      <p>
        Implementers should confirm that each representation they decide to
        support is interoperable with the same representation in other DID
        Methods.
      </p>

      <p>

      See [[DID-CORE]] for normative requirements associated with the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#data-model">Data Model</a>.

    <p class="note">
      See [[DID-CORE]] for normative requirements associated with
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#representations">Representations</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The DID document data model contains “properties” (such as `id`, `verificationMethod`, and `service`), which are
      defined in a way that is independent of a concrete representation. There are a number of known representations,
      including JSON and JSON-LD (defined by DID Core), and CBOR (defined by a DID WG Note). Additional representations
      (such as XML, YaML, CBOR-LD, and others) are possible and may be defined in the future. For each of these
      representations, a combination of production and consumption rules defines the concrete syntax of properties, but
      the semantics of properties are independent of any given representation. In other words, in every representation
      of a DID document, there is always a way to represent a `service` or a `verificationMethod`, and their meanings
      are consistent across conformant representations.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to “properties”, a DID document may also contain “representation-specific entries” which may be
      required by certain representations in order to be able to fully represent the DID document data model and its
      properties. For example, the JSON-LD representation (with media type `application/did+ld+json`) requires the
      `@context` representation-specific entry, in order to correctly express the semantics of properties such as `id`,
      `verificationMethod` or `service` within the JSON-LD representation. This enables JSON-LD’s semantics which are
      based on a decentralized, permissionless, open-world data model.
    </p>

    <p>
      In contrast to this, the JSON representation (with media type `application/did+json`) does not have this semantic
      capability; instead, (non-LD) JSON documents always need agreement on semantics in some out-of-band way that is
      not part of the document itself. In the case of DID documents using the JSON representation, those semantics are
      established by the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/">DID Spec Registries</a>. Therefore,
      establishing semantics of DID document properties in the JSON representation does not require any
      “representation-specific entries”, as is the case with the JSON-LD representation. The same is true for the CBOR
      representation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other examples of “representation-specific entries” could be XML namespace definitions, or YAML tags, although
      these particular representations have not been defined at the time of this writing.
    </p>

    <p>
      If an entry that is specific to one representation appears in another representation, it can be called a
      "representation-foreign entry". An example of this is an `@context` entry appearing in the `application/did+json`
      representation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Examples of “representation-specific entries” and “representation-foreign entries”:

      <h3>
        Avoid representation-foreign entries
      </h3>

      <p class="advisement">
        It is bad practice and potentially harmful for producers to include "representation-foreign entries" in DID
        documents.
      </p>

      <p>
        Different implementations of DID document consumers may or may not be able to properly understand the meaning
        and processing rules of representation-foreign entries. Since DIDs and DID documents form an open ecosystem with
        many producers and consumers, a producer cannot anticipate the behavior of a consumer with regard to
        representation-foreign entries.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, if a producer adds an `@context` entry to a DID document in the `application/did+json`
        representation, some consumers (those that understand JSON-LD, such as JSON-LD document loaders) may process it
        in one way, while other consumers (those that only understand plain JSON, without any JSON-LD specific rules)
        may process it in a different way.
      </p>

      <p>
        This can lead to inconsistent behavior by consumers that cannot be predicted by a producer.

        Reliance on representation-foreign entries
      </h3>

      <p class="advisement">
        It is bad practice and potentially harmful for consumers to rely on "representation-foreign entries" in DID
        documents.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a special case of the previous section, certain consumers may go as far as relying on the presence of
        representation-foreign entries. For example, an incorrectly implemented consumer of DID documents in the
        `application/did+json` representation may attempt to apply JSON-LD tooling to that representation. That tooling
        is dependent on the presence of the `@context` representation-foreign entry, which is not actually required (and
        in fact discouraged) to be used in the `application/did+json` representation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The result is lack of interoperability, since such consumers will throw errors even if the returned DID document
        representation is actually conformant.

      <h3>
        Security problems with representation-foreign entries
      </h3>

      <p>
        If some implementations of DID document consumers process representation-foreign entries, and others don’t, then
        this can lead to security holes, since the semantics of DID document properties will not be interpreted in a
        predictable way.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, consider the following DID document, and assume that the JSON-LD context
        `https://myextensions.com/other-definitions.jsonld` defines `blockchainAccountId` in a way that is different
        from the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/#blockchainaccountid">property listed in the DID
        Specification Registries</a>.
      </p>

      <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A DID document in the `application/did+json` representation with the `@context` representation-foreign entry">
{
  "@context":[
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
    "https://myextensions.com/other-definitions.jsonld"
  ],
  "id":"did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
  "verificationMethod":[{
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#vm-3",
    "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    "type": "EcdsaSecp256k1RecoveryMethod2020",
    "blockchainAccountId": "0xF3beAC30C498D9E26865F34fCAa57dBB935b0D74"
  }]
}
      </pre>

      <p>
        If this DID document is consumed as `application/did+json` by an implementation that doesn't understand JSON-LD,
        it will interpret `blockchainAccountId` as the <a
              href="https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/#blockchainaccountid">property listed in the DID
        Specification Registries</a>, and it will process it accordingly.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the exact same DID document is consumed as `application/did+json` by an implementation that understands
        JSON-LD, it may interpret `blockchainAccountId` using the provided JSON-LD context, and therefore process it
        differently.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is a common mistake to claim that "JSON-LD is just JSON", and to justify injecting the `@context`
        representation-foreign entry into a DID document in the `application/did+json` representation. This claim
        however is true only on the syntax level, but wrong and dangerous on the semantic level, especially when
        security-related properties are involved. In the example above, different consumer implementations are likely to
        come to different conclusions on how the DID can be controlled.
      </p>

      <p class="advisement">
        Representation-foreign entries in DID documents should be avoided, since they can lead to inconsistent and
        unpredictable DID control decisions.

      <h3>
        Conversion between Representations
      </h3>

      <p>
        The DID document data model and the production/consumption rules of representations have been designed to enable
        lossless conversion between representations. Conversion between representations is achieved by executing the
        consumption rules of the source representation, and then the production rules of the target representation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/">DID Specification Registries</a> provide additional
        information about properties as well as representation-specific entries that help with such conversion. For
        example, a DID document in the `application/did+json` representation can be converted to the
        `application/did+ld+json` representation by adding a `@context` representation-specific entry during production,
        using the JSON-LD context information in the DID <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/">Specification
        Registries</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Conversely, a DID document in the `application/did+ld+json` representation can be converted to the
        `application/did+json` representation by removing the `@context` representation-specific entry during
        consumption.
      </p>

      <p class="advisement">
        Representation-foreign entries in DID documents should be avoided, since the implications on lossless conversion
        between representations is unclear.

        The current specification does not take a position on the maximum length

        2048 characters. QR codes can handle about 4096 characters. Clients
        using <a>DIDs</a> will be responsible for storing many <a>DIDs</a>,
        and some methods would be able to externalize some of their costs
        onto clients by relying on more complicated signature schemes or by

        type of timestamp mechanism. Despite some transactional cost, they
        are the among the most censorship-resistant transaction ordering
        systems at the present, so they are nearly ideal for
